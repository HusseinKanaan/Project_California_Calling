                Last year, nearly 2 million acres were devastated by the deadliest, most destructive wildfires in
                California
                history.

        Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the California
        Grizzly
        and
        used it to create custom tees, pins and posters.
        Our t-shirts (kids and adult sizes), pins, and posters will be available for purchase at our exclusive pop-up
        shop
        during our SF Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday, June 21. You can choose what amount to donate. All proceeds
        will
        go
        to the American Red Cross to help the communities that are still displaced.

        The Golden Bear
        This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come out stronger
        than
        before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California poppy.
        — Kevin Lam, Artist

        The Poppy Bear
        This design is inspired by the quote ‘grow through what you go through’ and represents the strength of
        Californians
        and
        how we will continue to thrive, regardless of what knocks us down.
        — Alyssa Wigant, Artist
